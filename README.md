# LambdaCalculus

LambdaCalculus offers implementation for two programming language constructions: 
  1. Untyped lambda calculus with optional evaluation strategies (ULC).
  2. Simply typed lambda calculus with boolean and natural number extensions (STLC). 

ULC is implemented independently from the scratch whereas STLC is transpiled to ULC.
